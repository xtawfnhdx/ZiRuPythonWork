    "\n",
    "**Your solution explanation here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question requires us to use the Pandas library to complete 5 different tasks related to the dataset \"expenditure_data.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first thing that we need to do is to import the Pandas library and to name the data frame created from \"expenditure_data.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```head()``` method applied to the dataframe can be used to display the first n observations. This will be sufficient for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the region column only, and thus we will index the dataframe ```df_exp``` with the ```region``` label. This operation will return a Series object for which we can apply methods to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to count how many values of \"London\" appear in the series. The ```value_counts``` will return a Series containing counts of unique values. We can store this series in a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can index the stored series with the label \"London\" again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the median income in each region.\n",
    "2. Take their difference \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the median of income we can apply the ```median()``` function to the \"income\" column. However, we only need to consider households that live in \"East Mid\" and \"West Mid\" separately. This filtering can be done via Boolean indexing, i.e. find those rows that meet a condition (e.g. whether they live in \"East Mid\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the Boolean index, we will select those rows according to the region and pick the \"income\" column. This is done with the ```loc()``` method. Then, we apply the ```median()``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we take the difference of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are only interested in households that live in the \"Yorkshir\" area, we can create a new dataframe from the original one. Given the new dataframe, we can then compute the percentage by counting how many households spend over £400 and divide by total number of households.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 5:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to compute the average number of households. Therefore, we are interested in the \"nadults\" column of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the values in this column are strings, which is not a suitable data type to perform numerical operations such as an average. Hence, we first need to convert all strings to their correspondent numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```replace()``` method allows us to replace all values that we want to replace with a new value that we provide. We want to replace \"1 adult\" with the number 1, and so on. Notice the ```inplace=True``` argument is needed to correctly update the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we apply the ```mean()``` method to the \"nadult\" column to compute the mean."

    "- A list, or a dictionary, variable that stores all available titles. We can call this ```shelf```.\n",
    "- A list, or a dictionary, variable that stores all borrowed titles. We can call this ```account```.\n",
    "- A set of instructions that allow the user to pick a title from the ```shelf``` and add it to the ```account```.\n",

If a dictionary is used instead, we could ask for the key and get the associated value by indexing the dictionary with the key.\n",
